This app uses Node.js with React and Redux to query the backend set up at jsonstub.com. Bundling and minification are handled by webpack.

In a real world app I likely would have established better processes around building and deploying, but this is my first time deploying to Heroku and writing a React app completely from scratch so I didn't want to get too bogged down in the infrastructure. With additional time I would have also liked to clean up the styling more.

I did not get to the optional test UI, accessibility considerations, and dynamic loading on scroll.
